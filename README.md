Machine Learning Specialization - Course 3

Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains my completed programming assignments for the third course of the Machine Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and Stanford Online on Coursera.

ðŸ“š About This Course

This course covers three major areas of machine learning:

Unsupervised Learning: Discovering patterns in unlabeled data using techniques like K-Means clustering and anomaly detection.

Recommender Systems: Building systems that predict user preferences, using both collaborative and content-based filtering.

Reinforcement Learning: Training agents to make optimal decisions by interacting with an environment, focusing on value functions and continuous state spaces.
